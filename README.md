# PeriodicTableSimulation

My first project using Python. It simulates the atoms of the periodic table. It uses PyGame for the visuals and MYSQL database to store the properties of the atoms. I also tried implementing multiprocessing - but it's not necessary.

The project uses a script that fetches the atom properties from an api and then processes it and inserts it to a database.

What I learned developing the program:
- How to fetch data from API's
- How to setup and work with a MYSQL database
- How to create a visual GUI
